## Windows
### Option 1
- Set `IAR_TOOLCHAIN_PATH` as a Windows' system environment variable:
1. Press the "Start Menu", search for "Edit the system environment variables".
2. Enter with a new "System environment variable" as described below:

| Variable name | Value (Example) 
| - | -
| `IAR_TOOLCHAIN_PATH` | `C:\iar\ewarm-9.60.3`

### Option 2

```cmd
X:\>C:
C:\xxx>cd \IAR
C:\IAR>mklink /d ewarm ewarm-9.60.3
symbolic link created for ewarm <<===>> ewarm-9.60.3
```
